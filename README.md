# Turning LED Off and On | Arduino Controlling using Python
In this repo, I provide a simple Python code that can control the Arduino's digital pins with the help of Library called PyFirmata.
I faced the problem of not being able to access COM port of Arduino on Windows with other Arduino Python modules.
I think that the code in this repo would help you solve this problem.
